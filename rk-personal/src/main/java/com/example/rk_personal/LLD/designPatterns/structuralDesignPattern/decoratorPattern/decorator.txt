this is a structural design pattern.

it prevents the class explosion;

for example if we have classes of categories of pizza and toppings
when we want to create objects of these classes, we might end up in creating lot of classes because of
combinations possible


example there are 3 classes of A,B,C

how ever it is inevitable to create these 3 classes but imagine the combinations of these
[A,B] ,[A,C], [B,C],[A,B,C]

so we will end up creating a lot of classes to prevent this class explosion.

Decorator pattern is very handy.

** All the classes belongs to the same base class **
