this is creation design pattern useful for creating objects

best example is clone()
when we want to copy/clone of the object Student we need to know about all the attributes of the Student class
also if there are any private attributes/members we cant access them outside it wont be possible to
copy/clone of the object

Hence by implementing a clone method inside of the object itself we can avoid this problem

so whatever classes which implements ProtoType interface should override the clone method and
they can be easily copied/cloned.
